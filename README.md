Survival Prediction for Liver Cancer Patients<br>
• Conducted a comprehensive study on survival prediction for liver cancer patients using TCGA gene expression and clinical data.<br>
• Employed Kapan-Meir survival analysis to identify significant clinical features and Voom and Glmfit methods for identifying differentially expressed genes.<br>
• Developed a predictive model using machine learning techniques, comparing the performance of various classification algorithms on an 80:20 test-train split.<br>
• Demonstrated superior performance of the developed model in comparison to a baseline majority class selection approach, highlighting its potential for improving prognosis prediction in liver cancer patients. <br>
